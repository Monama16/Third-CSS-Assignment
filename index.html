                <p class="story">What impact has steve had on my life?Every short story I've written as an adult( and certainly every on that has been published), almost every email I've ever written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the star trek future i dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>
